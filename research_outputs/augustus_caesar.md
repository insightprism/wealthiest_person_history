# SAVE Research Report: Augustus Caesar

**Target Subject:** Gaius Octavius Thurinus (Augustus Caesar)
**Empire:** Roman Empire
**Peak Year:** 14 AD (end of reign, empire at maximum stability)
**Reign:** 27 BC – 14 AD

## I. Executive Summary

Augustus Caesar, the first Roman Emperor, transformed the Roman Republic into an empire that would dominate the Mediterranean world for centuries. At his death in 14 AD, the Roman Empire encompassed approximately 50-60 million people across a vast territory from Britain to Egypt. Augustus reformed taxation, established a professional standing army, built extensive road networks (50,000 miles), and annexed Egypt—whose revenues alone matched those of Gaul. His reign inaugurated the Pax Romana, a 200-year period of relative peace and economic prosperity.

## II. Variable Analysis

### 1. Population (N): **55,000,000**

**Derivation Logic:**
Population estimates for the Roman Empire at Augustus's death in 14 AD:
- Low estimates: 44 million
- Medium estimates: 50 million
- Higher estimates: 60 million

Using 55 million as a moderate estimate, accounting for:
- Core provinces around the Mediterranean
- Italy as the heartland
- Egypt (densely populated, ~5-7 million alone)
- Gaul, Hispania, and other western provinces
- Greek and Eastern provinces

**Sources:**
- [Roman economy - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_economy)
- [Augustus - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus)

**Confidence Score:** **Medium**
- Based on census data (though incomplete)
- Academic debate on total figures
- Generally accepted range of 44-60 million

---

### 2. Base Output (B): **0.8 oz/person/year**

**Derivation Logic:**
The Roman economy was pre-industrial but relatively advanced:
- GDP per capita estimated at $570 (1990 international dollars)
- Italia was wealthiest region, 40-66% higher than provincial average
- Significant regional variation (Egypt and Italy wealthy; frontier provinces poor)
- Large slave economy and subsistence agriculture
- Advanced for ancient world but still primarily agrarian

Using 0.8 oz (below default) because:
- Lower per capita output than medieval peak economies
- Large portion of population at subsistence level
- Regional inequality significant
- Compared to Song China or Mughal India, less productive per capita

**Sources:**
- [Roman Empire GDP Per Capita Map | Brilliant Maps](https://brilliantmaps.com/roman-empire-gdp/)
- [Roman economy - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_economy)

**Confidence Score:** **Medium**
- Academic estimates available
- Significant uncertainty in ancient GDP calculations
- Generally accepted as lower than medieval peak

---

### 3. Velocity (V): **4.5**

**Derivation Logic:**
Scoring based on economic indicators:

| Indicator | Assessment | Score Contribution |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| Standardized coinage | Excellent - aureus (gold), denarius (silver), sestertius (bronze) | +1.0 |
| Trade networks | Excellent - Mediterranean maritime trade, Silk Road connections | +1.0 |
| Banking/credit | Good - argentarii (bankers), money lending established | +0.5 |
| Currency systems | Strong - tri-metallic system, reliable weights | +0.5 |
| Market infrastructure | Good - extensive markets, grain dole system | +0.5 |
| Paper money | None | +0 |
| Road networks | Exceptional - 50,000 miles of paved roads, cursus publicus | +1.0 |

Total: Base 2.0 + 2.5 bonus = **4.5**

Rome had excellent infrastructure and trade networks but lacked sophisticated financial instruments like paper money or bills of exchange.

- [Aureus - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aureus)

**Confidence Score:** **High**
- Well-documented road system
- Extensive numismatic evidence
- Clear archaeological record of trade

---

### 4. Extraction Margin (M): **0.10**

**Derivation Logic:**
Roman taxation under Augustus was relatively moderate by ancient standards:
- Keith Hopkins estimated Roman taxes at ~5-7% of GDP
- Provincial wealth tax: ~1% annually
- Flat poll tax on adults
- Sales tax: 1% on auctions (later 0.5%)
- Inheritance tax: 5% (on non-family)
- Slave sales tax: 4%
- Customs duties: 2-2.5% (portoria)

Additional revenue sources:
- Tribute from provinces
- Egyptian grain and revenue
- Mining revenues (Spain, Romania)
- War booty (declining under Augustus's peace)

Using 10% extraction because:
- Base taxes around 5-7% of GDP
- Additional customs, tolls, and special taxes
- Provincial tribute systems
- Italy itself exempt from direct taxation

**Sources:**
- [Taxation in ancient Rome - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_ancient_Rome)
- [Roman Taxes | UNRV](https://www.unrv.com/economy/roman-taxes.php)
- [Politics of Taxation in the Roman Empire](https://www.austaxpolicy.com/politics-taxation-roman-empire/)

**Confidence Score:** **Medium-High**
- Tax rates documented in sources
- Hopkins's GDP estimate widely cited
- Some uncertainty in provincial variation

---

### 5. Capitalization Multiple (K): **20** (Default)

**Derivation Logic:**
Using the default multiple of 20 because:
- Augustus established durable institutions
- Pax Romana lasted ~200 years after him
- Clear succession (Tiberius)
- Professional army provided stability
- No immediate existential threats

No adjustment warranted from the standard 20x multiple.

**Confidence Score:** **High** (default value, appropriate for exceptionally stable empire)

---

### 6. Liquid Treasury (L): **200,000 oz**

**Derivation Logic:**
Treasury figures at Augustus's death:
- Public Roman Treasury held 4,000 silver talents (~100 million sestertii)
- Augustus's personal bequest: 43 million sestertii to Roman people + military bonuses
- Annual treasury income: 400-500 million sestertii

Converting to gold:
- 1 aureus = 25 denarii = 100 sestertii
- 1 aureus ≈ 0.25 troy oz gold
- 100 million sestertii = 1 million aurei = ~250,000 oz gold

However, this was a relatively low treasury level:
- Augustus spent heavily on building projects, army, and public works
- Much wealth distributed rather than accumulated
- Personal fortune mixed with state treasury (fiscus)

Estimate: 200,000 oz represents liquid reserves at death.

**Confidence Score:** **Medium**
- Treasury figures documented
- Conversion rates known
- Some uncertainty in total liquid reserves

---

### 7. Imperial Real Estate (R): **5,000,000 oz**

**Derivation Logic:**
Augustus controlled significant imperial property:
- Egypt was essentially the emperor's personal estate
- Imperial mines in Spain and Romania (major gold/silver sources)
- Crown lands throughout the provinces
- Palatine palaces and estates

Egypt alone generated enormous wealth:
- Alexandria produced ~36 million sestertii annually
- Egyptian revenues matched Gaul's 40 million sestertii annually
- Egypt's grain fed Rome

Estimate of 5 million oz reflects:
- Mining operations (Spanish gold and silver mines were legendary)
- Egyptian productive capacity
- Imperial estates throughout empire

**Sources:**
- [Augustus Caesar: The Wealth and Power of Rome's First Emperor](https://historyandartifacts.com/augustus-caesar-the-wealth-and-power-of-romes-first-emperor/)
- [Roman economy - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_economy)

**Confidence Score:** **Low**
- Qualitative evidence of significant holdings
- Specific valuations not documented
- Based on comparative analysis

---

### 8. Extraordinary Gains (E): **10,000,000 oz**

**Derivation Logic:**
Augustus acquired massive one-time wealth:
- **Conquest of Egypt (30 BC):** Ptolemaic treasury, one of the richest in the ancient world
- Cleopatra's treasury was legendary
- Egypt's revenues matched Gaul's conquest (40 million sestertii annually in perpetuity)
- War indemnities and spoils from civil wars
- Confiscated property from proscriptions

The conquest of Egypt was one of history's greatest single wealth captures:
- Ptolemaic Egypt had accumulated centuries of surplus
- Gold, silver, jewels, and art seized
- Grain reserves worth enormous amounts

Estimate of 10 million oz reflects the extraordinary nature of Egypt's capture—likely the largest single wealth transfer in ancient history.

**Confidence Score:** **Low-Medium**
- Egypt conquest well-documented as transformative
- Specific treasury values not recorded
- Conservative estimate given legendary accounts

## IV. Expected Calculation Preview

Using the SAVE formulas:

**Income Valuation:**
- AGR = N × B × V = 55,000,000 × 0.8 × 4.5 = 198,000,000 oz
- AII = AGR × M = 198,000,000 × 0.10 = 19,800,000 oz
- Income Wealth = AII × K = 19,800,000 × 20 = **396,000,000 oz**

**Asset Valuation:**
- Infrastructure = (N × B) × 0.05 = 44,000,000 × 0.05 = 2,200,000 oz
- Liquid Treasury = 200,000 oz
- Imperial Real Estate = 5,000,000 oz
- Extraordinary Gains = 10,000,000 oz
- Asset Wealth = 2,200,000 + 200,000 + 5,000,000 + 10,000,000 = **17,400,000 oz**

**Total Real Wealth:** 396,000,000 + 17,400,000 = **413,400,000 oz** (~413 million oz)

**Nominal Value (@ $2,900/oz):** ~$1.20 trillion USD

## VII. Caveats and Alternative Estimates

**Population Alternatives:**
- Lower estimate: 44 million (minimum scholarly estimate)
- Higher estimate: 60 million (maximum scholarly estimate)

**Base Output Alternatives:**
- Lower (0.6): If emphasizing poverty of frontier provinces
- Higher (1.0): If emphasizing Italy and Egypt's wealth

**Extraction Margin Alternatives:**
- Lower (0.07): Using Hopkins's minimum estimate
- Higher (0.12): If including all indirect revenue sources

**Treasury Alternatives:**
- Lower (100,000 oz): Based strictly on documented 4,000 talents
- Higher (500,000 oz): If including Augustus's personal fortune

**Extraordinary Gains Alternatives:**
- Lower (5,000,000 oz): Conservative estimate of Egyptian capture
- Higher (20,000,000 oz): If Egypt's treasury was as legendary as accounts suggest

The figures provided represent moderate estimates based on available scholarship. Augustus's wealth is notable for its systemic nature—he transformed Rome from a conquest economy to a sustainable imperial system, though the Extraordinary Gains from Egypt's capture were transformative.
