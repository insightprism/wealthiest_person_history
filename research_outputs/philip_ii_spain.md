# SAVE Research Report: Philip II of Spain

**Target Subject:** Philip II (Felipe II)
**Empire:** Spanish Empire (Castile, Aragon, Portugal, Netherlands, Americas, Philippines)
**Peak Year:** 1580 (Union with Portugal, maximum territorial extent)
**Reign:** 1556 – 1598
**Reference:** [Wikipedia - Philip II of Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_II_of_Spain)

## I. Executive Summary

Philip II of Spain ruled history's first truly global empire—spanning from the Philippines to the Americas to Europe. After the 1580 union with Portugal, he controlled almost all the explored New World plus a vast trading empire in Africa and Asia. New World silver shipments reached record levels after 1580, with roughly 16,000 tons of silver bullion unloaded between 1550-1650. However, maintaining this vast empire proved enormously expensive, and Philip declared bankruptcy four times. American treasure constituted only ~25% of royal revenues—the rest came from heavy taxation of his European domains.

## II. Variable Analysis

### 1. Population (N): **25,000,000**

**Derivation Logic:**
Philip II's domains included multiple realms:

**European Territories:**
- Castile: ~6.5 million (after 1580)
- Aragon/Catalonia/Valencia: ~1.5 million
- Portugal: ~1.5 million (after 1580)
- Netherlands/Low Countries: ~3 million
- Italian possessions (Naples, Sicily, Milan): ~5 million
- European subtotal: ~17.5 million

**Overseas Territories:**
- Americas (New Spain, Peru, etc.): ~10-15 million indigenous + colonists
- Philippines: ~1 million
- Portuguese overseas: ~1 million in African/Asian enclaves

However, for SAVE purposes, the relevant population is those under effective tax administration—primarily European domains.

Using 25 million to include:
- All European territories
- Colonial populations under Spanish administration

**Confidence Score:** **Medium**
- European populations reasonably documented
- Colonial populations uncertain
- Composite monarchy makes totaling complex

---

### 2. Base Output (B): **0.8 oz/person/year**

**Derivation Logic:**
The Spanish Empire had mixed economic characteristics:
- Advanced trade networks (Seville, Antwerp, Manila)
- Significant manufacturing (textiles, weapons)
- But Dutch Revolt disrupting Netherlands
- American silver causing inflation
- Agricultural base in Castile struggling

Using 0.8 oz (slightly below default) because:
- European territories relatively developed
- But economic distortions from silver inflation
- Military expenses draining productive capacity
- Price revolution causing economic disruption

**Sources:**
- [EH.net - American Treasure and Price Revolution](https://eh.net/book_reviews/american-treasure-and-the-price-revolution-in-spain-1501-1650/)
- [Britannica - Spain Philip II](https://www.britannica.com/place/Spain/Philip-II)

**Confidence Score:** **Medium**
- Economic disruption documented
- Per capita estimates require inference

---

### 3. Velocity (V): **5.5**

**Derivation Logic:**
Scoring based on economic indicators:

| Indicator | Assessment | Score Contribution |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| Standardized coinage | Excellent - Spanish real/peso became world currency | +1.0 |
| Trade networks | Exceptional - Manila Galleon, Atlantic trade, Antwerp | +1.5 |
| Banking/credit | Good - Genoese bankers, juros bonds | +0.5 |
| Currency systems | Strong - bi-metallic system | +0.5 |
| Market infrastructure | Good - Seville Casa de Contratación | +0.5 |
| Paper money | Limited - juros were debt instruments | +0.25 |
| Road/sea networks | Good - Armada, fleet system | +0.5 |

Total: Base 2.0 + 3.5 bonus = **5.5**

Spain operated the world's first global trade network, with the Spanish dollar becoming a de facto world currency.

**Sources:**
- [Spanish Empire - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Empire)
- [Britannica - Spain Philip II](https://www.britannica.com/place/Spain/Philip-II)

**Confidence Score:** **High**
- Trade networks well-documented
- Currency system established
- Global reach confirmed

---

### 4. Extraction Margin (M): **0.20**

**Derivation Logic:**
Philip II extracted heavily from all domains:
- American silver: ~25% of total royal revenue
- Alcabala (sales tax) in Castile: 10%
- Millones service: additional taxes
- Crusada and other church taxes
- Netherlands taxation (major grievance)
- Italian tributes

Evidence of high extraction:
- Declared bankruptcy 4 times (1557, 1560, 1575, 1596)
- "Philip ran primary surplus every year of reign"
- Heavy taxation triggered Dutch Revolt

Using 0.20 because:
- Multiple tax streams across composite monarchy
- New World treasure added to traditional taxes
- High military spending required high extraction

**Sources:**
- [Berkeley - Sustainable Debts of Philip II](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~webfac/cromer/e211_f07/voth.pdf)
- [Britannica - Spain Philip II](https://www.britannica.com/place/Spain/Philip-II)

**Confidence Score:** **Medium-High**
- Tax systems documented
- Revenue composition known
- Exact extraction rate estimated

---

### 5. Capitalization Multiple (K): **12**

**Derivation Logic:**
Reducing below default because of significant instability:
- Dutch Revolt ongoing (1568-1648)
- Spanish Armada disaster (1588)
- Four bankruptcies during reign
- Constant wars (France, England, Ottoman Empire)
- Economic distortion from silver inflation
- Empire in slow decline after Philip's death

A multiple of 12x reflects the severe fiscal and military strains.

**Confidence Score:** **High** (multiple bankruptcies documented)

---

### 6. Liquid Treasury (L): **20,000,000 oz**

**Derivation Logic:**
New World silver flows were enormous:
- 16,000 tons of silver bullion, 1550-1650
- 339,000 pounds of gold by 1600
- After 1580, "silver shipments reached record levels"

Converting:
- 16,000 tons silver over 100 years = 160 tons/year average
- At gold:silver ratio of 12:1, ~13 tons gold equivalent/year
- ~420,000 oz gold equivalent annually

Treasury estimate:
- Even with heavy spending, accumulated reserves significant
- Crown controlled silver arriving at Seville
- Estimate: 20 million oz in treasury reserves

But note: Philip was often bankrupt, so liquid cash was less than this.

**Sources:**
- [EH.net - American Treasure](https://eh.net/book_reviews/american-treasure-and-the-price-revolution-in-spain-1501-1650/)
- [JSTOR - Imports of American Gold and Silver](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1885920)

**Confidence Score:** **Medium**
- Silver flows documented
- Actual treasury levels harder to determine
- Bankruptcies indicate cash flow problems

---

### 7. Imperial Real Estate (R): **50,000,000 oz**

**Derivation Logic:**
Philip II controlled vast crown properties:
- American silver mines (Potosí, Zacatecas)
- Philippine trade (Manila)
- Crown lands throughout Spain and Italy
- Portuguese colonial possessions (after 1580)
- Royal alcazars, El Escorial palace

Potosí alone was legendarily productive:
- "Mountain of silver" - one of history's largest deposits
- Produced over 45,000 tons of silver, 1545-1825
- Crown received "quinto" (20%) of all production

Estimate of 50 million oz reflects:
- Mining rights (enormous value)
- Colonial trade monopolies
- Crown lands and properties

**Sources:**
- [Spanish Empire - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Empire)
- [Philip II of Spain - New World Encyclopedia](https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Philip_II_of_Spain)

**Confidence Score:** **Low-Medium**
- Mining output documented
- Full valuation uncertain
- Monopoly rights difficult to value

---

### 8. Extraordinary Gains (E): **30,000,000 oz**

**Derivation Logic:**
Philip II benefited from major conquests:
- **Portugal and its Empire (1580):** Gained Brazil, African colonies, Indian Ocean trade
- **Continued American conquest:** Mexico, Peru already conquered but ongoing extraction
- **War ransoms and booty**

The Portuguese annexation was particularly significant:
- Brought entire Portuguese colonial empire
- Brazilian sugar trade
- African gold trade
- Spice trade routes

Estimate of 30 million oz represents:
- Value captured from Portuguese annexation
- Accumulated conquest gains from Americas
- Treasures from various campaigns

**Sources:**
- [Philip II of Spain - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_II_of_Spain)
- [Spanish Empire - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Empire)

**Confidence Score:** **Low**
- Portugal annexation documented
- Monetary value not specified
- Based on qualitative assessments

## IV. Expected Calculation Preview

Using the SAVE formulas:

**Income Valuation:**
- AGR = N × B × V = 25,000,000 × 0.8 × 5.5 = 110,000,000 oz
- AII = AGR × M = 110,000,000 × 0.20 = 22,000,000 oz
- Income Wealth = AII × K = 22,000,000 × 12 = **264,000,000 oz**

**Asset Valuation:**
- Infrastructure = (N × B) × 0.05 = 20,000,000 × 0.05 = 1,000,000 oz
- Liquid Treasury = 20,000,000 oz
- Imperial Real Estate = 50,000,000 oz
- Extraordinary Gains = 30,000,000 oz
- Asset Wealth = 1,000,000 + 20,000,000 + 50,000,000 + 30,000,000 = **101,000,000 oz**

**Total Real Wealth:** 264,000,000 + 101,000,000 = **365,000,000 oz** (~365 million oz)

**Nominal Value (@ $2,900/oz):** ~$1.06 trillion USD

## VII. Caveats and Alternative Estimates

**Population Alternatives:**
- European only: 17 million
- Including Americas: 40+ million
- Used: 25 million (effective taxpaying population)

**Extraction Margin Alternatives:**
- Lower (0.15): If using American revenue only
- Higher (0.25): If including all indirect taxes

**Treasury Alternatives:**
- Lower (10,000,000 oz): Given constant bankruptcies
- Higher (30,000,000 oz): Peak silver accumulation

**The Bankruptcy Paradox:**
Philip II declared bankruptcy four times yet continued military operations. This apparent paradox is explained by:
- Bankruptcies were debt renegotiations, not total insolvency
- Revenue streams continued even during bankruptcies
- Primary surplus maintained throughout reign
- Debt was "sustainable until at least 1584"

**Price Revolution Impact:**
The massive silver inflows caused inflation throughout Europe:
- "Fivefold increase in prices" during Philip's reign
- This means nominal wealth figures must be interpreted carefully
- Real purchasing power may have been less than nominal figures suggest
