# SAVE Research Report: William the Conqueror

**Target Subject:** William I (William the Conqueror)
**Empire:** Kingdom of England (and Duchy of Normandy)
**Peak Year:** 1086 (Domesday Survey completed)
**Reign:** 1066 – 1087
**Reference:** [Wikipedia - William the Conqueror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_the_Conqueror)

## I. Executive Summary

William the Conqueror's conquest of England in 1066 was one of history's most complete transfers of wealth and power. The Domesday Book of 1086 provides remarkably detailed economic data for medieval England—recording every manor's value, resources, and tax assessment. William's royal lands were worth four times as much as the next largest landholder's, and the entire Anglo-Saxon aristocracy was replaced by fewer than 200 Norman barons. England's population in 1086 was approximately 2 million, with a primarily agrarian economy.

## II. Variable Analysis

### 1. Population (N): **2,000,000**

**Derivation Logic:**
The Domesday Book provides an unusually precise population estimate:
- Domesday records ~13,000+ place-names
- Academic consensus: ~2 million population in 1086
- Over 100,000 villeins (peasants) recorded
- These villeins headed ~1/3 of all households

Note: This includes only England; Normandy (William's original duchy) would add perhaps 500,000-1,000,000 more.

**Sources:**
- [Domesday Book - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesday_Book)
- [EBSCO - Domesday Survey](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/history/domesday-survey)

**Confidence Score:** **High**
- Domesday Book provides detailed records
- Academic consensus on ~2 million
- One of best-documented medieval populations

---

### 2. Base Output (B): **0.6 oz/person/year**

**Derivation Logic:**
11th century England was a primarily agrarian economy:
- Dominated by manorial agriculture
- Limited trade and manufacturing
- Technology: heavy plow, three-field rotation
- Some wool trade but primarily subsistence
- Post-conquest disruption (Harrying of the North)

Using 0.6 oz (below default) because:
- Medieval subsistence agriculture
- Limited commercial activity
- Recent conquest disruption
- No significant manufacturing

**Sources:**
- [EH.net - Economy at Norman Conquest](https://eh.net/encyclopedia/economy-of-england-at-the-time-of-the-norman-conquest/)
- [Medievalists.net - Domesday Economy](https://www.medievalists.net/2010/08/the-domesday-economy-of-england-1086/)

**Confidence Score:** **Medium**
- Domesday provides value data
- Per capita conversion estimated

---

### 3. Velocity (V): **2.5**

**Derivation Logic:**
Scoring based on economic indicators:

| Indicator | Assessment | Score Contribution |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| Standardized coinage | Limited - silver pennies, but coinage scarce | +0.25 |
| Trade networks | Limited - some wool trade, coastal commerce | +0.25 |
| Banking/credit | None - pre-banking economy | +0 |
| Currency systems | Silver penny standard but low circulation | +0.25 |
| Market infrastructure | Limited - local markets, few towns | +0.25 |
| Paper money | None | +0 |
| Road networks | Roman roads degraded, limited maintenance | +0 |

Total: Base 2.0 + 0.5 bonus = **2.5**

11th century England was largely a subsistence economy with limited monetary circulation. Most payments were in kind rather than coin.

- [History of the English fiscal system - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_English_fiscal_system)

**Confidence Score:** **Medium**
- Economic structure documented
- Monetary circulation uncertain

---

### 4. Extraction Margin (M): **0.15**

**Derivation Logic:**
William's extraction was notably heavy:
- Geld tax levied annually by end of reign
- Just south-western shires alone: >400,000 pennies in 1086
- Royal demesne: ~1,400 manors
- Confiscations from rebellions added to crown holdings
- Domesday's explicit purpose: assess taxable wealth

Evidence of heavy extraction:
- "The king's lands were worth four times as much as the next largest landholder"
- ~200 landowners with estates yielding £100+/year
- Comprehensive tax collection system (sheriffs, hundreds, "wealth gatherers")

Using 0.15 because:
- High medieval extraction
- Norman efficiency in collection
- But limited by agricultural economy

**Sources:**
- [The End of the Tax Year 1086 | Exon Domesday](https://www.exondomesday.ac.uk/blog/the-end-of-the-tax-year-1086/)
- [National Archives - Domesday Book](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/resources/domesday-book/)

**Confidence Score:** **Medium-High**
- Tax system well-documented
- Exact rates require estimation

---

### 5. Capitalization Multiple (K): **15**

**Derivation Logic:**
Reducing below default because:
- Constant threat of Danish invasion
- Rebellions (especially in the North)
- Succession uncertain (three sons competing)
- William died 1087, just after Domesday
- Norman dynasty lasted but with civil wars

A multiple of 15x reflects the instability of early Norman rule.

**Confidence Score:** **Medium** (succession was contested)

---

### 6. Liquid Treasury (L): **500,000 oz**

**Derivation Logic:**
William accumulated significant treasure:
- Left Henry (third son) 5,000 pounds silver in will
- Treasury kept at Winchester
- Conquest plunder from 1066 invasion
- Confiscations from English nobles and rebels

Estimating treasury:
- If 5,000 lbs silver was a portion for one son
- Total treasury likely much larger
- 1 pound sterling = 20 shillings = 240 silver pennies
- Medieval silver:gold ratio ~12:1

Estimate: 500,000 oz gold equivalent treasury
- Includes conquest plunder
- Accumulated taxes over 20+ years
- Confiscated wealth

**Sources:**
- [William the Conqueror - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_the_Conqueror)
- [Royal.uk - William I](https://www.royal.uk/william-the-conqueror)

**Confidence Score:** **Low**
- No complete treasury inventory
- Will mentions partial bequest
- Based on estimates

---

### 7. Imperial Real Estate (R): **2,000,000 oz**

**Derivation Logic:**
William controlled enormous royal demesne:
- ~1,400 manors listed as royal demesne in Domesday
- "King's lands worth four times the next largest landholder"
- Nearly 200 landowners had estates worth £100+/year
- Confiscated Anglo-Saxon estates

If ~200 estates averaged £100/year value:
- Total landowner income: ~£20,000/year
- William's share: ~£8,000/year (4x next largest)
- Capitalized at 20x = £160,000
- At medieval valuations, ~2 million oz gold equivalent

This includes:
- Royal forests (extensive hunting reserves)
- Crown manors throughout England
- Castles and fortifications

**Sources:**
- [Domesday Book - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesday_Book)
- [EH.net - Economy at Norman Conquest](https://eh.net/encyclopedia/economy-of-england-at-the-time-of-the-norman-conquest/)

**Confidence Score:** **Low-Medium**
- Domesday provides relative values
- Absolute conversion uncertain

---

### 8. Extraordinary Gains (E): **1,000,000 oz**

**Derivation Logic:**
The Norman Conquest was one of history's greatest wealth transfers:
- Entire Anglo-Saxon aristocracy dispossessed
- "Lands of over 4,000 English lords passing to less than 200 Norman barons"
- Harold Godwinson's treasury captured
- Church wealth partially seized
- Harrying of the North (1069-70) - systematic plunder

Estimate of 1 million oz represents:
- Anglo-Saxon royal treasury captured
- Noble estates confiscated
- Church treasures seized
- Conquest plunder from 1066

**Sources:**
- [Domesday Book - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesday_Book)
- [William the Conqueror - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_the_Conqueror)

**Confidence Score:** **Low**
- Conquest wealth not inventoried
- Based on scale of dispossession
- Qualitative descriptions only

## IV. Expected Calculation Preview

Using the SAVE formulas:

**Income Valuation:**
- AGR = N × B × V = 2,000,000 × 0.6 × 2.5 = 3,000,000 oz
- AII = AGR × M = 3,000,000 × 0.15 = 450,000 oz
- Income Wealth = AII × K = 450,000 × 15 = **6,750,000 oz**

**Asset Valuation:**
- Infrastructure = (N × B) × 0.05 = 1,200,000 × 0.05 = 60,000 oz
- Liquid Treasury = 500,000 oz
- Imperial Real Estate = 2,000,000 oz
- Extraordinary Gains = 1,000,000 oz
- Asset Wealth = 60,000 + 500,000 + 2,000,000 + 1,000,000 = **3,560,000 oz**

**Total Real Wealth:** 6,750,000 + 3,560,000 = **10,310,000 oz** (~10.3 million oz)

**Nominal Value (@ $2,900/oz):** ~$29.9 billion USD

## VII. Caveats and Alternative Estimates

**Population Alternatives:**
- England only: 2,000,000 (used)
- England + Normandy: 2,500,000-3,000,000

**Base Output Alternatives:**
- Lower (0.4): If emphasizing post-conquest devastation
- Higher (0.8): If using pre-conquest prosperity

**Treasury Alternatives:**
- Lower (200,000 oz): Conservative estimate
- Higher (1,000,000 oz): If conquest plunder was larger

**Extraordinary Gains Alternatives:**
- Lower (500,000 oz): Conservative estimate
- Higher (3,000,000 oz): If full scale of dispossession valued

**Note on Domesday as Source:**
The Domesday Book is exceptional among medieval sources for its detail. However, it records values in pounds/shillings/pence (silver), and conversion to gold ounces requires assumptions about medieval exchange rates and the meaning of "annual value" entries.

**Excluding Normandy:**
This report focuses on England. William was also Duke of Normandy, which would add significant population and wealth if included.
