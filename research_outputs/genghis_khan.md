# SAVE Research Report: Genghis Khan

**Target Subject:** Temüjin / Genghis Khan (Chinggis Khaan)
**Empire:** Mongol Empire
**Peak Year:** 1227 (death, empire at maximum under his direct rule)
**Reign:** c. 1206 – 1227
**Reference:** [Wikipedia - Genghis Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genghis_Khan)

## I. Executive Summary

Genghis Khan built the largest contiguous land empire in history, ruling from the Pacific Ocean to the Caspian Sea by his death in 1227. The empire was twice the size of the Roman Empire or Muslim Caliphate at their heights. His conquests extracted what historians estimate as "trillions of dollars" in plunder from the Jin Dynasty (China), the Khwarezmian Empire (Persia/Central Asia), and countless cities along the Silk Road. Unlike conventional rulers, Genghis Khan measured wealth in horses, weapons, and "wagonloads of gold"—distributing spoils among his warriors rather than accumulating a personal treasury.

## II. Variable Analysis

### 1. Population (N): **60,000,000**

**Derivation Logic:**
Population under Mongol control at Genghis Khan's death (1227):

**Conquered Territories:**
- Northern China (Jin Dynasty territories): ~50 million (before conquest)
- Khwarezmian Empire (Central Asia/Persia): ~5-10 million
- Western Xia: ~2-3 million
- Mongol heartland: ~1-2 million

However, Mongol conquests caused massive population loss:
- "80 million deaths from Mongol conquests" (some estimates)
- China's population reportedly fell from 120M to 60M during Mongol rule

Using 60 million as controlled population in 1227:
- Reflects territories actually held
- Accounts for conquest-related population loss
- Conservative estimate of administrative control

**Sources:**
- [Mongol Empire - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_Empire)
- [Britannica - Mongol Empire](https://www.britannica.com/place/Mongol-empire)

**Confidence Score:** **Low-Medium**
- Massive population disruption during conquests
- Administrative control varied by region
- Pre-modern census data unavailable

---

### 2. Base Output (B): **0.5 oz/person/year**

**Derivation Logic:**
The Mongol Empire economy was unique:
- Mongols themselves were nomadic pastoralists
- Conquered populations included advanced civilizations (Jin China)
- Conquest devastated cities and agricultural systems
- Khwarezm irrigation "destroyed for centuries"
- Focus on military extraction, not productive development

Using 0.5 oz (low) because:
- Nomadic base economy (low fixed output)
- Conquest destroyed productive capacity
- China's agricultural surplus devastated
- Recovery took generations

**Sources:**
- [Richmond Fed - Genghis Khan Trade Warrior](https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/econ_focus/2021/q4_economic_history)
- [Britannica - Mongol Empire](https://www.britannica.com/place/Mongol-empire)

**Confidence Score:** **Medium**
- Economic disruption well-documented
- Mixed economy (nomadic + conquered agricultural)

---

### 3. Velocity (V): **3.0**

**Derivation Logic:**
Scoring based on economic indicators:

| Indicator | Assessment | Score Contribution |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| Standardized coinage | Limited - various currencies from conquered regions | +0.25 |
| Trade networks | Good - Silk Road protected under Mongol rule | +0.5 |
| Banking/credit | Limited | +0 |
| Currency systems | Fragmented - Chinese, Persian, etc. | +0.25 |
| Market infrastructure | Variable - cities destroyed, Silk Road functional | +0.25 |
| Paper money | Yes in China (Jin/Yuan currency) | +0.25 |
| Road networks | Good - yam postal relay system | +0.5 |

Total: Base 2.0 + 1.0 bonus = **3.0**

Genghis Khan did protect the Silk Road and establish efficient communication (yam system), but conquest disrupted existing economic systems.

**Sources:**
- [Mongol Empire - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_Empire)
- [World History Encyclopedia - Mongol Empire](https://www.worldhistory.org/Mongol_Empire/)

**Confidence Score:** **Medium**
- Silk Road protection documented
- Economic disruption also documented

---

### 4. Extraction Margin (M): **0.30**

**Derivation Logic:**
Mongol extraction was extremely high but unconventional:
- "Khubi" system: each royal family member entitled to share of all wealth
- Initial extraction: war booty, military requisition, tribute
- "The Mongols procured vast amounts of silver and tributes"
- Cities that resisted were often completely destroyed and plundered

Evidence of high extraction:
- 10% of conquered population might be enslaved
- Entire treasuries seized from Jin, Khwarezmia
- Agricultural taxation after stabilization

Using 0.30 because:
- Extremely heavy extraction during conquest phase
- Plunder was systematic
- Less organized taxation vs. later Yuan dynasty

**Sources:**
- [Richmond Fed - Genghis Khan Trade Warrior](https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/econ_focus/2021/q4_economic_history)
- [OpenStax - Chinggis Khan](https://openstax.org/books/world-history-volume-1/pages/14-2-chinggis-khan-and-the-early-mongol-empire)

**Confidence Score:** **Medium**
- Extraction was severe
- Exact rates uncertain

---

### 5. Capitalization Multiple (K): **15**

**Derivation Logic:**
Reducing below default because:
- Empire based on conquest momentum
- Succession uncertain (sons competed)
- Empire split into khanates after Genghis's death
- Required constant expansion for spoils distribution
- Genghis's own death ended expansion briefly

However, the empire did continue:
- Lasted until 1368 (Yuan dynasty)
- Khanates persisted for centuries

Using 15x as moderate multiple for a conquest state.

**Confidence Score:** **Medium** (empire did fragment but persisted)

---

### 6. Liquid Treasury (L): **50,000,000 oz**

**Derivation Logic:**
Genghis Khan accumulated vast plunder:
- Jin Dynasty: "vast amounts of silver and tributes, amounting to hundreds of billions in current value"
- Khwarezmian treasuries of Bukhara, Samarkand, Urgench
- Silk Road cities' accumulated wealth
- "Enormous wagon train of gold, silver, diamonds, silks" at his funeral

But Genghis Khan distributed spoils:
- "Divided the spoils among his soldiers and the greater Mongol community"
- "Enormous treasury remained with the ruling Borjigin clan"
- Not accumulated in single treasury

Estimate of 50 million oz reflects:
- Plundered treasuries from multiple civilizations
- Distributed across Borjigin clan
- Significant retention for "further expansion"

- [Richmond Fed - Genghis Khan](https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/econ_focus/2021/q4_economic_history)

**Confidence Score:** **Low**
- Spoils distributed, not centralized
- No treasury inventory exists
- "Trillions" in modern terms is vague

---

### 7. Imperial Real Estate (R): **10,000,000 oz**

**Derivation Logic:**
Unlike settled empires, Mongols valued mobility:
- Nomadic culture didn't value fixed real estate
- Conquered cities often destroyed rather than held
- Genghis's capital was mobile tent city
- No equivalent of palaces, crown lands

However, some assets:
- Karakorum (capital) under construction
- Grazing lands for millions of horses
- Silk Road route control

Using low estimate of 10 million oz because:
- Nomadic culture minimized fixed assets
- Value was in mobility and herds
- Real estate less relevant to Mongol wealth concept

**Sources:**
- [Genghis Khan - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genghis_Khan)

**Confidence Score:** **Medium**
- Nomadic culture documented
- Fixed assets not emphasized

---

### 8. Extraordinary Gains (E): **100,000,000 oz**

**Derivation Logic:**
Genghis Khan's wealth was almost entirely from conquest:

**Major Plunder Events:**
- **Jin Dynasty (1211-1215):** Beijing fell 1215, immense treasury captured
- **Khwarezmia (1219-1221):** Bukhara, Samarkand, Urgench - Silk Road wealth accumulated for centuries
- **Western Xia (1227):** Final campaign, complete destruction

Scale of plunder:
- "Trillions of dollars in gold, silver, silks, spices, livestock, and land value"
- "From the Chinese Jin Dynasty alone... vast amounts of silver"
- "In the Islamic realm, treasure from Persia and Silk Road cities"

Estimate of 100 million oz reflects:
- One-time capture of Jin treasury
- Khwarezmian accumulated wealth
- Silk Road cities' treasuries
- This was PRIMARY source of Mongol wealth

**Sources:**
- [Mongolian Empire - Genghis Khan Net Worth](https://mongolianempire.com/post/unveiling-the-riches-of-genghis-khan-exploring-the-net-worth-of-the-mongol-empires-founder/)
- [Vocal Media - Genghis Khan Conquests](https://vocal.media/history/genghis-khan-the-shadow-of-conquest-a-chronicle-of-the-bloodiest-campaigns-in-history)

**Confidence Score:** **Low**
- Scale acknowledged as "immense" by historians
- No precise inventories exist
- "Trillions" suggests very large amounts

## IV. Expected Calculation Preview

Using the SAVE formulas:

**Income Valuation:**
- AGR = N × B × V = 60,000,000 × 0.5 × 3.0 = 90,000,000 oz
- AII = AGR × M = 90,000,000 × 0.30 = 27,000,000 oz
- Income Wealth = AII × K = 27,000,000 × 15 = **405,000,000 oz**

**Asset Valuation:**
- Infrastructure = (N × B) × 0.05 = 30,000,000 × 0.05 = 1,500,000 oz
- Liquid Treasury = 50,000,000 oz
- Imperial Real Estate = 10,000,000 oz
- Extraordinary Gains = 100,000,000 oz
- Asset Wealth = 1,500,000 + 50,000,000 + 10,000,000 + 100,000,000 = **161,500,000 oz**

**Total Real Wealth:** 405,000,000 + 161,500,000 = **566,500,000 oz** (~567 million oz)

**Nominal Value (@ $2,900/oz):** ~$1.64 trillion USD

## VII. Caveats and Alternative Estimates

**MAJOR CAVEAT:** Genghis Khan's wealth was fundamentally different from settled rulers:
- Nomadic culture valued horses, warriors, and mobility over gold
- Spoils were distributed, not accumulated personally
- "Treasury" was clan property, not personal
- Empire was in conquest mode, not stable extraction

**Population Alternatives:**
- Lower (40 million): If excluding recently conquered areas
- Higher (100 million): If counting all claimed territory

**Extraction Alternatives:**
- Lower (0.20): If focusing on sustainable taxation
- Higher (0.40): If emphasizing plunder phase

**Extraordinary Gains Alternatives:**
- Lower (50,000,000 oz): Conservative plunder estimate
- Higher (200,000,000 oz): If "trillions" taken more literally

**The "Lost Treasure" Mystery:**
Legend describes an "enormous wagon train" of gold, silver, and diamonds buried with Genghis Khan at Burkhan Khaldun mountain. The tomb has never been found. This suggests large concentrated wealth existed—but its exact value remains unknown.

**Comparison to Settled Empires:**
The SAVE model works better for settled empires with:
- Stable tax systems
- Documented treasuries
- Fixed real estate

Genghis Khan represents an edge case—his wealth was real but organized differently than the model assumes.
