# SAVE Research Report: King Solomon

**Target Subject:** King Solomon (Shlomo)
**Empire:** United Kingdom of Israel
**Peak Year:** 950 BC (mid-reign, Temple construction complete)
**Reign:** c. 970 – 931 BC
**Reference:** [Wikipedia - Solomon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon)

---

## I. Executive Summary

King Solomon presents a unique challenge for wealth valuation: biblical accounts describe fabulous wealth (666 talents of gold annually, a Temple worth billions), while archaeological evidence suggests a much smaller kingdom. Modern scholars debate whether Solomon ruled a prosperous unified monarchy or merely a modest tribal chieftaincy. This report attempts to find a middle ground, using biblical sources for income flows (which have some archaeological corroboration) while applying conservative estimates for population and economic capacity based on archaeological constraints.

**Important Caveat:** The figures below blend biblical claims with archaeological reality. Users should understand the significant uncertainty involved.

---

## II. Variable Analysis

### 1. Population (N): **400,000**

**Derivation Logic:**
Archaeological evidence strongly constrains population estimates:
- Finkelstein suggests Judah's population was as small as 5,000
- More moderate estimates suggest 60,000 for early kingdom
- Jerusalem alone: 2,000-5,000 people (10th century BC)
- Biblical accounts claim much larger numbers (census of David: 1.3 million fighting men, implying 5+ million total)

Using 400,000 as a moderate compromise:
- Represents the "maximalist" archaeological view
- Includes both Judah and Israel (united monarchy)
- Accounts for nomadic populations harder to detect archaeologically
- Still far below biblical claims

**Sources:**
- [Quora - Population of Ancient Israel](https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-population-of-ancient-Israel)
- [David and Solomon's Kingdom | Ancient Near East Today](https://anetoday.org/david-and-solomons-kingdom/)
- [BAS Library - Jerusalem's Population](https://library.biblicalarchaeology.org/sidebar/jerusalems-population-through-the-ages/)

**Confidence Score:** **Low**
- Major scholarly debate exists
- Archaeological evidence contested
- Biblical figures likely exaggerated
- Wide range of estimates (5,000 to millions)

---

### 2. Base Output (B): **0.6 oz/person/year**

**Derivation Logic:**
Ancient Israel's economy was primarily pastoral and agricultural:
- Iron Age Levantine economy
- No significant manufacturing
- Trade routes important but infrastructure limited
- Drought-prone climate in much of territory
- Bronze Age technology transitioning to Iron Age

Using 0.6 oz (below default) because:
- Pre-classical ancient economy
- Limited technological development
- Primarily subsistence agriculture
- Trade income concentrated with royalty

**Sources:**
- General economic history of ancient Levant

**Confidence Score:** **Medium**
- Standard assumptions for ancient Near Eastern economies
- Limited direct evidence

---

### 3. Velocity (V): **3.0**

**Derivation Logic:**
Scoring based on economic indicators:

| Indicator | Assessment | Score Contribution |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| Standardized coinage | None - pre-coinage economy, weighted silver used | +0 |
| Trade networks | Good - Phoenician partnership, Red Sea trade | +0.5 |
| Banking/credit | Minimal | +0 |
| Currency systems | Commodity money (silver, gold by weight) | +0.5 |
| Market infrastructure | Limited - Jerusalem temple as economic center | +0.25 |
| Paper money | None | +0 |
| Road networks | Moderate - trade routes but not paved roads | +0.25 |

Total: Base 2.0 + 1.0 bonus = **3.0**

Solomon's kingdom had notable trade connections (ships of Tarshish, Ophir expeditions) but lacked the monetary sophistication of later empires.

- [Solomon - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon)

**Confidence Score:** **Medium**
- Trade routes documented
- Economic infrastructure uncertain
- Pre-coinage economy limits velocity

---

### 4. Extraction Margin (M): **0.25**

**Derivation Logic:**
Biblical accounts suggest high extraction:
- Heavy taxation mentioned (led to kingdom split after Solomon)
- Corvée labor: 180,000 laborers for Temple construction
- "The king became so immensely rich that all his cups were made of gold"
- Trade monopolies through royal merchant fleet
- Tribute from subject peoples

Using 0.25 because:
- Direct royal control of trade revenues
- Forced labor systems
- Tribute from vassal states
- Biblical text notes heavy taxation caused resentment

**Sources:**
- [Bible Study - How Rich Was Solomon](https://www.biblestudy.org/basicart/how-rich-was-solomon.html)
- [National Geographic - King Solomon](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/story-king-solomon-wise-temple)

**Confidence Score:** **Medium**
- Biblical accounts describe heavy taxation
- Led to kingdom split (historical marker)
- Corvée labor well-documented in texts

---

### 5. Capitalization Multiple (K): **10**

**Derivation Logic:**
Reducing below default because:
- Kingdom split immediately after Solomon's death
- Significant internal unrest over taxation
- Surrounding hostile powers (Egypt, Aram)
- No clear succession stability (Rehoboam's failed leadership)
- United monarchy lasted only ~80 years total (David + Solomon)

A multiple of 10x reflects the inherent instability.

**Confidence Score:** **High** (the kingdom did split immediately upon Solomon's death)

---

### 6. Liquid Treasury (L): **10,000,000 oz**

**Derivation Logic:**
Biblical accounts provide specific figures:
- Annual gold income: 666 talents = ~22,644 kg = ~728,000 oz gold annually
- 40-year reign could accumulate: 29 million oz
- However, massive spending on Temple (100,000 talents gold, 1 million talents silver)
- Temple construction: 7.5 years with 180,000 laborers

Specific inflows:
- Queen of Sheba gift: 120 talents gold (~4,000 oz)
- Ophir expedition: 420 talents gold (~14,000 oz per voyage)
- Regular Tarshish fleet returns

Using 10 million oz as treasury reserve because:
- Massive inflows documented
- But equally massive outflows (Temple, palaces, military)
- Represents accumulated surplus after construction
- Conservative given biblical claims

**Sources:**
- [King Solomon's Gold: 905 Tons](https://believehim.org/solomon-how-rich/)
- [Net Worth of King Solomon | Vibro Media](https://vibromedia.com/net-worth-of-king-solomon/)
- [Temple Mount - Treasures of the Temple](https://www.templemount.org/TMTRS.html)

**Confidence Score:** **Low**
- Biblical figures are specific but contested
- No archaeological confirmation of treasury
- Likely exaggerated but pattern of wealth plausible

---

### 7. Imperial Real Estate (R): **5,000,000 oz**

**Derivation Logic:**
Solomon controlled significant assets:
- Copper mines at Timna/Punon (archaeological evidence exists)
- Royal merchant fleet (joint venture with Tyre)
- Temple and palace complex (valued at tens of billions in biblical accounts)
- Crown lands throughout kingdom

Using 5 million oz to represent:
- Mining operations (copper, possibly gold)
- Fleet assets
- Infrastructure investments

**Sources:**
- [Solomon - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon)
- Archaeological evidence of Timna copper mines

**Confidence Score:** **Low**
- Mining operations have archaeological support
- Specific valuations not available
- Fleet assets uncertain

---

### 8. Extraordinary Gains (E): **0 oz**

**Derivation Logic:**
Unlike his father David, Solomon was not a conqueror:
- Reign characterized by peace ("Solomon" from "shalom")
- No major military campaigns or pillaging
- Inherited David's conquests
- Wealth came from trade and tribute, not war booty

Setting to 0 because ongoing trade/tribute is captured in extraction margin, not as one-time gains.

**Sources:**
- [Solomon - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon)

**Confidence Score:** **High** (Solomon's peaceful reign is consistent across sources)

## IV. Expected Calculation Preview

Using the SAVE formulas:

**Income Valuation:**
- AGR = N × B × V = 400,000 × 0.6 × 3.0 = 720,000 oz
- AII = AGR × M = 720,000 × 0.25 = 180,000 oz
- Income Wealth = AII × K = 180,000 × 10 = **1,800,000 oz**

**Asset Valuation:**
- Infrastructure = (N × B) × 0.05 = 240,000 × 0.05 = 12,000 oz
- Liquid Treasury = 10,000,000 oz
- Imperial Real Estate = 5,000,000 oz
- Extraordinary Gains = 0 oz
- Asset Wealth = 12,000 + 10,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 0 = **15,012,000 oz**

**Total Real Wealth:** 1,800,000 + 15,012,000 = **16,812,000 oz** (~16.8 million oz)

**Nominal Value (@ $2,900/oz):** ~$48.8 billion USD

## VII. Caveats and Alternative Estimates

**MAJOR CAVEAT:** Solomon's wealth is uniquely contested. The estimates below represent the range of scholarly opinion.

### "Minimalist" Archaeological View
If accepting that Solomon ruled only a small chieftaincy:
- Population: 5,000-60,000
- Total wealth: Hundreds of thousands of oz (wealthy tribal chief)
- No significant treasury accumulation

### "Maximalist" Biblical View
If accepting biblical accounts more literally:
- Population: 1-3 million
- Annual gold income: 666 talents (~728,000 oz/year)
- 40-year accumulation: 29+ million oz
- Treasury: 50-100 million oz
- Total wealth: 100+ million oz

### This Report's Moderate Position
- Accepts trade network evidence (Phoenician partnership, silver hoards)
- Uses conservative population (400,000)
- Accepts some biblical wealth claims (scaled down)
- Results in ~17 million oz total wealth

**Population Alternatives:**
- Minimalist: 20,000 (Jerusalem + immediate hinterland)
- Maximalist: 2,000,000 (accepting biblical census figures)

**Treasury Alternatives:**
- Minimalist: 100,000 oz (wealthy tribal chief)
- Maximalist: 50,000,000 oz (biblical accounts)

**Note on Year Format:** The year -950 uses negative numbers to represent BC dates as specified in the SAVE model.

The figures provided represent a deliberate compromise between archaeological constraints and biblical tradition. Users may wish to run sensitivity analyses using both minimalist and maximalist assumptions.
