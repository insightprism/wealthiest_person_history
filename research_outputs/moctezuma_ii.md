# SAVE Research Report: Moctezuma II

**Target Subject:** Moctezuma Xocoyotzin (Montezuma II)
**Empire:** Aztec Empire (Mexica)
**Peak Year:** 1519 (just before Spanish arrival)
**Reign:** 1502/1503 – 1520
**Reference:** [Wikipedia - Moctezuma II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moctezuma_II)

## I. Executive Summary

Moctezuma II ruled the Aztec Empire at its greatest territorial extent, commanding tribute from 38 provinces with 489 communities. His capital, Tenochtitlan, was one of the largest cities in the world (200,000-300,000 people), larger than any European city at the time. The empire's wealth flowed through a sophisticated tribute system—gold dust, cacao beans, cotton textiles, quetzal feathers, and jade. Annual gold tribute alone was 435-536 kg (~14,000-17,000 oz). The empire ended abruptly with the Spanish conquest in 1521.

## II. Variable Analysis

### 1. Population (N): **15,000,000**

**Derivation Logic:**
Population estimates for the Aztec Empire vary:
- Higher estimate: 20 million
- Lower estimate: 15 million (38 provinces, 489 communities)
- Tenochtitlan alone: 200,000-300,000

Using 15 million because:
- More conservative scholarly consensus
- Empire covered central Mexico to Guatemala
- Pre-Columbian populations subject to debate

**Sources:**
- [Aztec Empire - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_Empire)
- [History Crunch - Moctezuma II](https://www.historycrunch.com/moctezuma-ii.html)
- [EBSCO - Reign of Montezuma II](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/history/reign-montezuma-ii)

**Confidence Score:** **Low-Medium**
- No census existed
- Wide range in scholarly estimates
- Population collapse post-conquest obscures baseline

---

### 2. Base Output (B): **0.5 oz/person/year**

**Derivation Logic:**
The Aztec economy was sophisticated but pre-industrial:
- Advanced agriculture (chinampas, irrigation)
- No metal tools (Stone Age technology)
- No wheeled vehicles or draft animals
- No iron/steel production
- Limited long-distance trade compared to Old World
- Primarily agricultural subsistence

Using 0.5 oz (below default) because:
- Neolithic technology level
- No metallurgical industry
- Limited transportation infrastructure
- But sophisticated intensive agriculture

**Sources:**
- [History Crunch - Aztec Economy](https://www.historycrunch.com/aztec-economy.html)

**Confidence Score:** **Medium**
- Economic structure documented
- Per capita comparisons difficult

---

### 3. Velocity (V): **3.0**

**Derivation Logic:**
Scoring based on economic indicators:

| Indicator | Assessment | Score Contribution |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| Standardized coinage | None - cacao beans and textiles used | +0.25 |
| Trade networks | Good - extensive regional markets | +0.5 |
| Banking/credit | Limited | +0 |
| Currency systems | Commodity money (cacao, cotton capes) | +0.25 |
| Market infrastructure | Excellent - Tlatelolco market was huge | +0.5 |
| Paper money | None | +0 |
| Road networks | Good - causeways, but no wheeled transport | +0.25 |

Total: Base 2.0 + 1.0 bonus = **3.0**

The Aztec economy had sophisticated markets but lacked metal coinage and advanced transportation.

**Sources:**
- [Aztec Empire - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_Empire)
- [Mexicolore - Aztec Money](https://www.mexicolore.co.uk/aztecs/kids/aztec-money)

**Confidence Score:** **Medium**
- Market system documented
- Commodity money described
- Spanish accounts confirm sophistication

---

### 4. Extraction Margin (M): **0.20**

**Derivation Logic:**
The Aztec tribute system was extensive:
- 38 provinces paying tribute
- Annual gold tribute: 435-536 kg
- Millions of cacao beans collected
- Textiles, feathers, jade, food
- Corvée labor for construction

Evidence of significant extraction:
- Codex Mendoza documents tribute amounts
- Conquered peoples resented tribute (allied with Spanish)
- Tenochtitlan's luxury depended on tribute

Using 0.20 because:
- Heavy tribute extraction from subject peoples
- Less direct taxation of own citizens
- Significant corvée labor demands

**Sources:**
- [Met Museum - Golden Kingdoms Tributes](https://www.metmuseum.org/perspectives/golden-kingdoms-ancient-tributes)
- [History Crunch - Aztec Economy](https://www.historycrunch.com/aztec-economy.html)

**Confidence Score:** **Medium**
- Tribute lists preserved
- Exact economic proportions uncertain

---

### 5. Capitalization Multiple (K): **5**

**Derivation Logic:**
Using very low multiple because:
- Empire only existed since ~1428 (~90 years)
- Constant warfare to maintain
- Subject peoples hostile (later allied with Spanish)
- No formal succession system
- Empire collapsed immediately upon Spanish contact

The Aztec Empire was inherently unstable—it was destroyed within 2 years of Spanish arrival.

**Confidence Score:** **High** (empire did collapse immediately)

---

### 6. Liquid Treasury (L): **1,000,000 oz**

**Derivation Logic:**
Moctezuma's treasury was legendary but modest by Old World standards:
- Annual gold tribute: 435-536 kg = ~14,000-17,000 oz
- Over 17 years of reign: ~250,000-290,000 oz gold accumulated (if not spent)
- Cacao beans: reportedly "nearly a billion" stored
- Textiles, feathers, jade in warehouses

Gold was not as central to Aztec economy as to Europeans:
- Valued for beauty, not as money
- Much gold was worked into decorative objects
- "Montezuma's Treasure" was coveted by Spanish

Estimate of 1 million oz reflects:
- Accumulated gold tribute
- Value of other treasuries (cacao, textiles)
- Conservative estimate vs. Spanish legends

**Sources:**
- [Vocal Media - Vanished Fortune of Montezuma](https://vocal.media/history/the-vanished-fortune-of-emperor-montezuma-the-lost-gold-of-the-aztecs)
- [Grokipedia - Montezuma's Treasure](https://grokipedia.com/page/Montezuma's_treasure)

**Confidence Score:** **Low**
- Treasury looted by Spanish
- No accurate inventory survives
- Spanish accounts potentially exaggerated

---

### 7. Imperial Real Estate (R): **500,000 oz**

**Derivation Logic:**
Moctezuma controlled significant property:
- Tenochtitlan itself (one of world's largest cities)
- Palaces and temples (Great Temple complex)
- Royal gardens and zoos
- Chinampas (floating gardens)
- No precious metal mines (gold came as tribute)

Unlike European or Asian rulers, Aztecs didn't control:
- Gold/silver mines (minimal local deposits)
- Long-distance trade monopolies
- Industrial production

Estimate of 500,000 oz reflects:
- Urban real estate value
- Temple and palace complexes
- Agricultural infrastructure

**Sources:**
- [Moctezuma II - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moctezuma_II)

**Confidence Score:** **Low**
- Valuation highly speculative
- Different economic system

---

### 8. Extraordinary Gains (E): **0 oz**

**Derivation Logic:**
Moctezuma expanded the empire through conquest:
- Extended territory to Oaxaca, Chiapas
- Incorporated Zapotec and Yopi peoples

However, Aztec conquests were primarily for:
- Tribute relationships (ongoing revenue)
- Sacrificial victims
- Not one-time treasure seizures

The tribute system is already captured in extraction margin. No evidence of major one-time treasury captures like Old World conquests.

**Sources:**
- [Moctezuma II - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moctezuma_II)

**Confidence Score:** **Medium** (conquest pattern well-documented)

## IV. Expected Calculation Preview

Using the SAVE formulas:

**Income Valuation:**
- AGR = N × B × V = 15,000,000 × 0.5 × 3.0 = 22,500,000 oz
- AII = AGR × M = 22,500,000 × 0.20 = 4,500,000 oz
- Income Wealth = AII × K = 4,500,000 × 5 = **22,500,000 oz**

**Asset Valuation:**
- Infrastructure = (N × B) × 0.05 = 7,500,000 × 0.05 = 375,000 oz
- Liquid Treasury = 1,000,000 oz
- Imperial Real Estate = 500,000 oz
- Extraordinary Gains = 0 oz
- Asset Wealth = 375,000 + 1,000,000 + 500,000 + 0 = **1,875,000 oz**

**Total Real Wealth:** 22,500,000 + 1,875,000 = **24,375,000 oz** (~24.4 million oz)

**Nominal Value (@ $2,900/oz):** ~$70.7 billion USD

## VII. Caveats and Alternative Estimates

**MAJOR CAVEAT:** The Aztec Empire operated on fundamentally different economic principles than Old World empires. Gold was decorative, not monetary. Wealth was measured in cacao, feathers, and textiles. Comparison to gold-based systems is inherently problematic.

**Population Alternatives:**
- Lower estimate: 10 million (conservative)
- Higher estimate: 20-25 million (some sources)

**Base Output Alternatives:**
- Lower (0.3): If emphasizing Stone Age technology
- Higher (0.7): If emphasizing agricultural surplus

**Capitalization Multiple Alternatives:**
- Higher (10): If ignoring imminent collapse
- Lower (3): If emphasizing structural instability

**Treasury Alternatives:**
- Lower (500,000 oz): Conservative gold-only estimate
- Higher (3,000,000 oz): If accepting Spanish accounts of vast treasure

**The "Montezuma's Treasure" Problem:**
Spanish accounts describe fabulous wealth, but:
- Much treasure was lost (La Noche Triste)
- Spanish melted gold for weight, not artistry
- Exaggeration motivated by conquest narratives
- True value was in unique artworks, not bullion

The Aztec Empire's wealth was real but of a different character than European wealth—based on tribute relationships, agricultural surplus, and commodity currencies rather than precious metal accumulation.
