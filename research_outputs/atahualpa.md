# SAVE Research Report: Atahualpa

**Target Subject:** Atahualpa (Last Free-Reigning Inca Emperor)
**Empire:** Inca Empire (Tawantinsuyu)
**Peak Year:** 1532 (just before Spanish capture)
**Reign:** 1532 – 1533 (short reign after civil war)
**Reference:** [Wikipedia - Atahualpa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atahualpa)

---

## I. Executive Summary

Atahualpa was the last free-reigning emperor of the Inca Empire, captured by Francisco Pizarro at Cajamarca in November 1532. He offered history's most famous ransom—a room filled with gold (22 feet × 17 feet × 9 feet high) plus two rooms of silver. The Spanish received approximately 6,100 kg of 22-karat gold and 11,820 kg of silver, worth an estimated $387-500 million today. Despite paying this unprecedented ransom, Atahualpa was executed in July 1533. The Inca Empire (Tawantinsuyu) stretched 2,500 miles along the Andes with a population of 10-14 million, operating one of history's most successful centrally planned economies—without money or markets.

## II. Variable Analysis

### 1. Population (N): **12,000,000**

**Derivation Logic:**
Population estimates for the Inca Empire vary:
- Lower estimate: 6 million
- Higher estimate: 14 million
- Common scholarly estimate: 10-12 million at maximum extent

Using 12 million because:
- Empire at peak territorial extent under Huayna Capac (Atahualpa's father)
- Civil war and smallpox had begun reducing population by 1532
- Conservative within the higher scholarly range

The empire extended from modern Ecuador through Peru, Bolivia, and into Chile and Argentina.

- [Brewminate - Tahuantinsuyu](https://brewminate.com/tahuantinsuyu-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-inca-empire-1438-1533/)

**Confidence Score:** **Low-Medium**
- No census existed
- Wide range in scholarly estimates
- Civil war and disease complicating assessment

---

### 2. Base Output (B): **0.4 oz/person/year**

**Derivation Logic:**
The Inca economy was unique and sophisticated but pre-industrial:
- No money, no markets—entirely state-directed economy
- Advanced terrace agriculture (andenes)
- Sophisticated irrigation systems
- 35,000 km road network (Qhapaq Ñan)
- No wheeled vehicles or draft animals
- No iron tools (bronze age technology)
- Primarily agricultural subsistence

Using 0.4 oz (below default) because:
- Bronze Age technology level
- No metallurgical money economy
- Limited long-distance trade compared to Old World
- But highly organized agricultural surplus system
- State granaries (qollcas) stored years of food reserves

**Sources:**
- [Wikipedia - Economy of the Inca Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_Inca_Empire)
- [Discover Peru - Inca Economy](http://www.discover-peru.org/inca-economy-society/)

**Confidence Score:** **Medium**
- Economic structure well-documented
- Per capita comparisons difficult for non-monetary economy

---

### 3. Velocity (V): **2.5**

**Derivation Logic:**
Scoring based on economic indicators:

| Indicator | Assessment | Score Contribution |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| Standardized coinage | None - no money used | +0 |
| Trade networks | Internal redistribution only | +0.25 |
| Banking/credit | None | +0 |
| Currency systems | None - labor tax (mit'a) instead | +0 |
| Market infrastructure | None - state distribution | +0 |
| Paper money | None | +0 |
| Road networks | Excellent - 35,000 km Qhapaq Ñan | +0.5 |
| State organization | Exceptional - centrally planned | +0.25 |

Total: Base 2.0 + 0.5 bonus = **2.5**

The Inca economy was remarkably efficient but operated on entirely different principles than monetary economies. Wealth circulated through state redistribution, not market exchange.

- [Michigan Journal of Economics - Labor and Power in the Incan Economy](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/mje/2022/12/19/labor-and-power-in-the-incan-economy/)

**Confidence Score:** **Medium**
- Non-monetary system makes velocity concept problematic
- State efficiency documented

---

### 4. Extraction Margin (M): **0.25**

**Derivation Logic:**
The Inca state extracted heavily through the mit'a labor tax:
- Every able-bodied citizen owed labor to the state
- Mit'a laborers served as soldiers, farmers, builders, miners
- State controlled all surplus production
- Two-thirds of all land designated for state and religion
- Only one-third for local communities

Evidence of high extraction:
- Massive construction projects (Machu Picchu, road system)
- Standing army of conquest
- State granaries with multi-year food reserves
- Gold and silver production for religious/state use

Using 0.25 because:
- Very high labor extraction
- But extraction was through labor, not monetary taxation
- Reciprocity system provided some return to citizens

**Sources:**
- [Study.com - Inca Economy](https://study.com/academy/lesson/inca-economy-overview-history-facts.html)
- [Wikipedia - Economy of the Inca Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_Inca_Empire)

**Confidence Score:** **Medium**
- Mit'a system documented
- Exact labor/surplus ratios estimated

---

### 5. Capitalization Multiple (K): **5**

**Derivation Logic:**
Using very low multiple because:
- Empire only existed since 1438 (~94 years)
- Civil war had just ended (Atahualpa vs. Huáscar)
- Smallpox devastation beginning (killed Huayna Capac ~1527)
- Spanish contact imminent
- Empire collapsed within months of Spanish arrival

The Inca Empire was destroyed within 1-2 years of Atahualpa's capture. Even without Spanish conquest, the civil war and disease epidemics had severely weakened it.

**Confidence Score:** **High** (empire collapsed immediately)

---

### 6. Liquid Treasury (L): **3,000,000 oz**

**Derivation Logic:**
Atahualpa's ransom provides concrete evidence:

**The Documented Ransom:**
- 6,100 kg of 22-karat gold = ~196,000 troy oz gold
- 11,820 kg of silver = ~380,000 troy oz silver
- At 12:1 gold:silver ratio, silver = ~32,000 oz gold equivalent
- **Ransom total: ~228,000 oz gold equivalent**

But the ransom was only a fraction of Inca gold:
- Collected in 4 months from nearest provinces
- Much treasure hidden or thrown into lakes (legend of El Dorado)
- Temple of the Sun (Coricancha) in Cusco had golden walls
- "Garden of Gold" with life-size gold plants and animals
- Llama trains were still delivering when ransom declared complete

Estimate of 3 million oz reflects:
- Known ransom (~228,000 oz)
- Remaining empire gold not delivered
- Silver reserves throughout empire
- Temple and palace treasures

**Sources:**
- [Wikipedia - Ransom Room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransom_Room)
- [World History Encyclopedia - Pizarro and Atahualpa](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/704/pizarro-and-atahualpa-the-curse-of-the-lost-inca-g/)
- [National Geographic - How Spain's Lust for Gold Doomed the Inca Empire](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/history-magazine/article/inca-empire-gold-spain-pizarro-atahualpa-treasure)

**Confidence Score:** **Medium**
- Ransom precisely documented by Spanish
- Total empire treasure unknown
- Much hidden or lost

---

### 7. Imperial Real Estate (R): **2,000,000 oz**

**Derivation Logic:**
The Inca Empire controlled vast productive assets:

**Infrastructure:**
- 35,000 km road network (Qhapaq Ñan)
- Thousands of agricultural terraces
- Sophisticated irrigation systems
- Qollcas (granaries) storing years of food
- Tambos (way stations) along roads

**Royal Properties:**
- Palaces throughout the empire
- Machu Picchu and other royal estates
- Temple of the Sun (Coricancha)
- Fortresses (Sacsayhuamán)

**Mining:**
- Gold mines (but limited compared to later Spanish extraction)
- Silver deposits
- Copper and tin for bronze

Estimate of 2 million oz reflects:
- Massive infrastructure investment
- Royal estates and temples
- Mining rights (though gold valued decoratively, not monetarily)

**Sources:**
- [Wikipedia - Inca Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_Empire)

**Confidence Score:** **Low**
- Infrastructure impressive but valuation speculative
- Non-monetary economy makes comparison difficult

---

### 8. Extraordinary Gains (E): **0 oz**

**Derivation Logic:**
Atahualpa had just won a civil war against his brother Huáscar:
- War lasted 5+ years
- Atahualpa captured Huáscar shortly before Spanish arrived
- But civil war was destructive, not acquisitive
- No foreign conquests during Atahualpa's brief reign

Inca gold was accumulated over generations, not through Atahualpa's conquests.

Setting to 0 as no one-time treasure captures.

**Sources:**
- [Wikipedia - Atahualpa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atahualpa)
- [Britannica - Atahuallpa](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Atahuallpa)

**Confidence Score:** **High** (civil war documented)

## IV. Expected Calculation Preview

Using the SAVE formulas:

**Income Valuation:**
- AGR = N × B × V = 12,000,000 × 0.4 × 2.5 = 12,000,000 oz
- AII = AGR × M = 12,000,000 × 0.25 = 3,000,000 oz
- Income Wealth = AII × K = 3,000,000 × 5 = **15,000,000 oz**

**Asset Valuation:**
- Infrastructure = (N × B) × 0.05 = 4,800,000 × 0.05 = 240,000 oz
- Liquid Treasury = 3,000,000 oz
- Imperial Real Estate = 2,000,000 oz
- Extraordinary Gains = 0 oz
- Asset Wealth = 240,000 + 3,000,000 + 2,000,000 + 0 = **5,240,000 oz**

**Total Real Wealth:** 15,000,000 + 5,240,000 = **20,240,000 oz** (~20.2 million oz)

**Nominal Value (@ $2,900/oz):** ~$58.7 billion USD

## VII. Caveats and Alternative Estimates

**MAJOR CAVEAT:** The Inca Empire operated without money or markets. The SAVE model's concepts of "velocity" and "extraction" must be interpreted differently for a centrally planned, non-monetary economy. Wealth was measured in labor capacity, stored grain, textiles, and ceremonial gold—not currency.

**The Ransom as Evidence:**
The Atahualpa ransom provides rare concrete data:
- 6,100 kg gold + 11,820 kg silver = documented fact
- Spanish kept meticulous records
- This was collected in 4 months from nearest provinces only
- Represents floor, not ceiling, of Inca gold reserves

**Population Alternatives:**
- Lower estimate: 6 million (minimal)
- Higher estimate: 14 million (maximum)
- Used: 12 million (moderate-high)

**Treasury Alternatives:**
- Lower (1,000,000 oz): Just ransom and immediate reserves
- Higher (10,000,000 oz): If "lost Inca gold" legends accurate

**The "Lost Gold" Legend:**
When word spread of Atahualpa's execution, Incas reportedly:
- Hid llama trains of gold en route to Cajamarca
- Threw treasures into Lake Titicaca and other sacred waters
- Concealed the "Garden of Gold" from Coricancha
- This "lost Inca gold" has never been found

**Comparison to Moctezuma II:**
Both Atahualpa and Moctezuma ruled New World empires conquered by Spanish:
- Moctezuma II: ~24.4 million oz (Aztec Empire)
- Atahualpa: ~20.2 million oz (Inca Empire)
- Similar scale despite different economic systems
- Both empires collapsed within 2 years of Spanish contact

**The Tragedy:**
Atahualpa paid the largest ransom in history—and was executed anyway. The ransom room (El Cuarto del Rescate) still stands in Cajamarca, Peru, a monument to one of history's most infamous betrayals.
