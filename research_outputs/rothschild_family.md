# SAVE Research Report: The Rothschild Family

**Target Subject:** Rothschild Family (Banking Dynasty)
**Entity:** Private Banking Family (Not Sovereign Rulers)
**Peak Year:** 1850 (mid-19th century peak)
**Dynasty:** 1760s – Present (founded by Mayer Amschel Rothschild, 1744-1812)
**Reference:** [Wikipedia - Rothschild Family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothschild_family)

## I. Executive Summary

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The Rothschilds were a private banking family, not sovereign rulers. The SAVE model is designed for sovereigns who extract taxes from populations. The Rothschilds' wealth came from private banking, government loans, railroad investments, and mining. This report adapts the model using asset-only valuation.

During the 19th century, the Rothschild family possessed the largest private fortune in the world—and some historians argue the largest in modern history. They invented government bond issuance, financed Napoleon's defeat, saved the Bank of England in 1825-26, and built 25,000+ kilometers of railroads across Europe. By mid-century, they were "not king of the Jews but the Jew of the kings" (Thackeray). Their decline came after 1870 as joint-stock banks eroded their oligopoly.

## II. Variable Analysis

### MODIFIED APPROACH FOR PRIVATE FAMILY

Since the Rothschilds did not rule any population, the standard Income Valuation formula is not applicable. This report focuses on:
1. **Asset Valuation** (estimated peak wealth)
2. **Historical context** of their financial power

### 1. Population (N): **N/A - Not Sovereigns**

The Rothschilds were subjects of various European states (Britain, France, Austria, Germany, Italy). They did not rule any territory.

For **context only**: They financed governments controlling ~200 million Europeans.

**But this is NOT used for calculation.**

---

### 2-5. Income Parameters: **NOT APPLICABLE**

As private bankers, the Rothschilds did not:
- Extract taxes from populations
- Control monetary velocity as sovereigns
- Have capitalization multiples on sovereign income

**Income Valuation = 0 oz** (model not applicable)

---

### 6. Liquid Treasury (L): **100,000,000 oz**

**Derivation Logic:**
The Rothschilds' wealth at mid-19th century peak:

**Documentary Evidence:**
- Nathan Rothschild arranged £5 million Prussian loan (1818) = £440 million in 2023
- In 1825-26, Nathan supplied enough coin to save Bank of England from liquidity crisis
- Government bond portfolios worth billions (equivalent to trillions today)
- "Largest private fortune in the world" - undisputed by historians

**Comparative Estimates:**
- Some estimates: "richer than Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates combined"
- At 1850 gold prices (~$20/oz), vast fortunes were possible
- Modern claims of "$500 trillion" are debunked fantasy
- Credible estimates suggest billions in 19th century terms

**Converting to gold ounces:**
- If family fortune was $1-2 billion in 1850s money
- At $20/oz gold: 50-100 million oz gold equivalent

Using 100 million oz as estimate of peak combined family wealth across all five branches.

- [Celebrity Net Worth - Rothschild Wealth](https://www.celebritynetworth.com/articles/entertainment-articles/how-rich-is-the-rothschild-family/)

**Confidence Score:** **Low**
- Peak wealth not precisely documented
- Family was secretive
- Assets spread across five branches
- Modern claims range wildly

---

### 7. Imperial Real Estate (R): **50,000,000 oz**

**Derivation Logic:**
The Rothschilds controlled massive productive assets:

**Railroads:**
- Rothschild-financed railroads: "over 25,000 kilometers" across Europe
- Austrian Northern Railway
- French, Italian rail investments
- At 1850s construction costs, billions invested

**Mining:**
- Rio Tinto copper mines (>30% ownership by 1905)
- De Beers diamond mines (largest shareholders from 1887)
- These investments came slightly after 1850 peak

**Real Estate:**
- Waddesdon Manor and multiple estates in England
- Château Lafite winery (acquired 1868)
- Properties across Europe

**Banking Houses:**
- Five major banking establishments (Frankfurt, London, Paris, Vienna, Naples)
- Vaults, buildings, infrastructure

Estimate of 50 million oz reflects:
- Railroad investments (largest component)
- Bank real assets
- Mining interests (growing after 1850)
- Estate holdings

**Sources:**
- [Rothschild Family - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothschild_family)
- [Rothschild Banking Family of England - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothschild_banking_family_of_England)

**Confidence Score:** **Low**
- Railroad values difficult to estimate
- Mining interests developed over time
- Family holdings opaque

---

### 8. Extraordinary Gains (E): **20,000,000 oz**

**Derivation Logic:**
The Rothschilds accumulated wealth through extraordinary financial coups:

**Napoleonic Wars:**
- Financed British war effort against Napoleon
- Nathan reportedly made fortune at Waterloo (timing disputed)
- Post-war bond speculation highly profitable

**Crisis Profits:**
- 1825-26: Saved Bank of England, likely profited from position
- Various government debt restructurings

**Government Bond Innovation:**
- "Virtually invented the government bond"
- First-mover advantage in sovereign debt markets
- Enormous profits from bond issuance fees and trading

Estimate of 20 million oz represents extraordinary gains from:
- Napoleonic Wars financing
- Financial crisis opportunities
- First-mover bond market advantages

**Sources:**
- [Britannica Money - Rothschild Family](https://www.britannica.com/money/Rothschild-family)
- [European Leaders - Rothschild Family History](https://theeuropeanleaders.com/blog/rothschild-family-history/)

**Confidence Score:** **Low**
- Napoleonic profits legendary but unquantified
- Family records largely private
- Based on historical reputation

## IV. Expected Calculation Preview

**MODIFIED CALCULATION (Asset-Only for Private Family):**

Since Income Valuation is not applicable:
- **Income Wealth = 0 oz** (not sovereigns)

**Asset Valuation:**
- Infrastructure = 0 oz (no population)
- Liquid Treasury = 100,000,000 oz
- Imperial Real Estate = 50,000,000 oz
- Extraordinary Gains = 20,000,000 oz
- **Asset Wealth = 170,000,000 oz**

**Total Real Wealth:** 0 + 170,000,000 = **170,000,000 oz** (~170 million oz)

**Nominal Value (@ $2,900/oz):** ~$493 billion USD

## VII. Caveats and Alternative Estimates

**CRITICAL CAVEATS:**

### 1. Not Sovereign Rulers
The SAVE model is designed for sovereigns. The Rothschilds were private citizens whose wealth came from banking and investment, not taxation or territory control.

### 2. Family vs. Individual
Unlike most SAVE subjects, this represents a **family** across five branches, not an individual ruler. The wealth was distributed among cousins, not concentrated.

### 3. Debunked Conspiracy Theories
Claims that the Rothschilds are worth "$500 trillion" or control "80% of world wealth" are **completely false**:
- World total wealth in 2015: ~$250 trillion
- Only one Rothschild made Forbes billionaire list (2015)
- Family fortune was divided among many descendants
- Banking dominance ended by late 19th century

### Alternative Estimates:

**Conservative:**
- Modern verifiable wealth: ~$1-15 billion (today)
- Peak historical: ~$50 million oz

**Moderate (used here):**
- Peak historical: ~170 million oz
- Equivalent to ~$500 billion modern

**Maximum Plausible:**
- Peak historical: ~300 million oz
- If "largest private fortune in history" taken literally

### Decline After Peak:
By 1870s-1880s:
- Joint-stock banks competed
- New commercial banks emerged
- Family split reduced coordination
- "No longer first banking consortium"

Today:
- Rothschild & Co. is a global financial advisory firm
- No family member among world's top billionaires
- Wealth divided among many descendants
