# SAVE Research Report: Jakob Fugger

**Target Subject:** Jakob Fugger "the Rich" (Jakob Fugger von der Lilie)
**Entity:** Fugger Family Banking House (Private Enterprise)
**Peak Year:** 1525 (death, peak documented wealth)
**Life:** 1459 – 1525
**Reference:** [Wikipedia - Jakob Fugger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakob_Fugger)

## I. Executive Summary

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Jakob Fugger was not a sovereign ruler but a private merchant banker. The SAVE model is designed for sovereigns who control populations and extract taxes. Fugger's wealth came from private enterprise—mining, banking, and trade—not from ruling a population. This report adapts the model to estimate his wealth, but the Income Valuation component is not directly applicable.

Jakob Fugger is considered one of the wealthiest individuals in history, with estimates of his fortune at approximately $400 billion (2015 dollars) or 2% of Europe's GDP at his death in 1525. He controlled approximately 80% of Europe's copper production, financed the election of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, and held a near-monopoly on key commodities. His documented net worth at death was 2,032,652 guilders.

## II. Variable Analysis

### MODIFIED APPROACH FOR PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL

Since Fugger did not rule a population, the standard Income Valuation formula (N × B × V × M × K) is not directly applicable. Instead, this report focuses on:
1. **Asset Valuation** (his actual documented wealth)
2. **Contextual comparison** to sovereign wealth

### 1. Population (N): **N/A - Not a Sovereign**

Jakob Fugger did not rule any population. He was a subject of the Holy Roman Empire, operating primarily from the Free Imperial City of Augsburg.

For **comparative context only**, if we were to estimate the "economic population" his business touched:
- Fugger copper mines employed thousands of workers
- Business operations spanned much of Central Europe
- Influence over ~50 million people in Habsburg territories (as their banker)

**But this is NOT used for calculation.**

---

### 2-5. Income Parameters: **NOT APPLICABLE**

As a private individual, Fugger did not:
- Extract taxes from a population
- Control economic velocity as a sovereign
- Have a capitalization multiple on sovereign income

**Income Valuation = $0 oz** (model not applicable to private individuals)

---

### 6. Liquid Treasury (L): **65,000,000 oz**

**Derivation Logic:**
Fugger's documented wealth at death:
- Net assets at death: 2,032,652 guilders (after liabilities)
- Gross assets: 3,000,058 guilders
- This represented ~2% of European GDP

Converting to gold ounces:
- 1 guilder (florin) ≈ 3.5 grams gold in early 16th century
- 2 million guilders × 3.5g = 7,000 kg gold = ~225,000 troy oz

However, this seems too low given "$400 billion" modern estimates. The discrepancy arises because:
- Fugger's documented guilders were just liquid assets
- His mining rights, business value, and loans were worth far more
- The "$400 billion" estimate values the entire enterprise

Using the modern $400 billion estimate:
- At $2,900/oz gold, $400 billion = ~138 million oz
- This likely overstates; using conservative 50% = **65 million oz**

This represents the capitalized value of Fugger's entire enterprise.

**Confidence Score:** **Medium**
- Documented guilder amount is precise (2 million)
- Modern $ equivalent highly speculative
- Business valuation methodology unclear

---

### 7. Imperial Real Estate (R): **20,000,000 oz**

**Derivation Logic:**
Fugger controlled massive productive assets:
- Copper mines in Hungary and Tyrol (~80% of European copper by 1520)
- Silver mining operations
- Annual mining revenues: >100,000 florins
- Real estate throughout Europe
- The Fuggerei housing complex (still standing)

Estimating mining asset value:
- If mining generated 100,000 florins/year
- Capitalized at 20x = 2 million florins just for mines
- Plus real estate, trade goods, receivables

Estimate of 20 million oz reflects:
- Mining concessions (extremely valuable)
- Trade infrastructure
- Real property holdings

- [Britannica - Fugger Family](https://www.britannica.com/money/Fugger-family)

**Confidence Score:** **Low**
- Mining rights difficult to value
- No complete asset inventory
- Based on comparative estimates

---

### 8. Extraordinary Gains (E): **10,000,000 oz**

**Derivation Logic:**
Fugger accumulated wealth through extraordinary financial operations:
- Loan to finance Charles V's election: 543,000-550,000 florins (Fugger's share)
- Total election financing: 850,000 florins
- Interest and repayment profits on Habsburg loans
- Mining rights received as loan collateral

These were extraordinary gains from political financing, not regular business income.

- [Europeana - Meet the Fuggers](https://www.europeana.eu/en/stories/meet-the-fuggers-jakob-the-rich-and-his-family)

**Confidence Score:** **Low**
- Political loans documented
- Returns on loans uncertain
- Value of mining collateral estimated

## IV. Expected Calculation Preview

**MODIFIED CALCULATION (Asset-Only for Private Individual):**

Since Income Valuation is not applicable:
- **Income Wealth = 0 oz** (not a sovereign)

**Asset Valuation:**
- Infrastructure = 0 oz (no population)
- Liquid Treasury = 65,000,000 oz
- Imperial Real Estate = 20,000,000 oz
- Extraordinary Gains = 10,000,000 oz
- **Asset Wealth = 95,000,000 oz**

**Total Real Wealth:** 0 + 95,000,000 = **95,000,000 oz** (~95 million oz)

**Nominal Value (@ $2,900/oz):** ~$275 billion USD

## V. Machine-Readable JSON Output

**NOTE:** This JSON uses a modified approach since Fugger was not a sovereign. Setting income parameters to minimal values to focus on assets.

```json
{
  "ruler_name": "Jakob Fugger (Private Banker)",
  "year": 1525,
  "population": 1,
  "base_output": 0.01,
  "velocity": 2.0,
  "extraction_margin": 0.01,
  "capitalization_multiple": 1,
  "liquid_treasury": 65000000,
  "imperial_real_estate": 20000000,
  "extraordinary_gains": 10000000
}
```

**Alternative "Proper" Calculation:**
If you want to see Fugger's wealth properly without the income valuation, manually sum the asset values:
- Total = 65M + 20M + 10M = **95 million oz**

## VII. Caveats and Alternative Estimates

**CRITICAL CAVEAT:** The SAVE model is designed for sovereign rulers who extract taxes from populations. Jakob Fugger was a private citizen whose wealth came entirely from business activities. The Income Valuation component is fundamentally inapplicable.

### Alternative Approaches

**1. Pure Asset Approach (Used Above):**
- Sum of documented/estimated assets
- Result: ~95 million oz
- Nominal: ~$275 billion

**2. Modern Estimate Approach:**
- Steinmetz's $400 billion estimate
- At $2,900/oz = ~138 million oz
- This represents the maximum scholarly estimate

**3. Documented Guilder Approach:**
- 2,032,652 guilders at death
- ~225,000 oz gold directly
- This is the minimum documented figure

### Comparison to Sovereigns

For perspective, Fugger's wealth (~95M oz) compared to contemporary sovereigns:
- Charles V (Holy Roman Emperor, whom Fugger financed)
- Henry VIII of England
- Francis I of France

Fugger may have been wealthier than many of these kings in liquid assets, though they controlled far more in sovereign income streams.

### Wealth Type Differences

| Type | Sovereigns | Fugger |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Tax Revenue | Yes | No |
| Population Control | Yes | No |
| Mining Rights | Some | Yes (80% copper) |
| Banking/Loans | Limited | Primary Business |
| Military | Yes | No (hired) |

The SAVE model captures sovereign power; Fugger represents a different form of wealth—commercial/financial—that influenced sovereigns but operated differently.
